= Cloudera Cloud Basecamp


=== Overview

This boot camp is a hands-on training session designed new hire members of the consulting
and pre-sales organizations.

We focus on the common elements of a professional services engagement

1. data ingestion
1. data engineering
1. data warehouse
1. data steaming
1. data science

So you basically the is a data basecamp

We are going to:

* Expanding out a single use case solution over the week.
* Simulating a customer engagement with real problem solving

=== Prerequisites

We've designed this training as a exercises of getting started with the
Cloudera public cloud stack.

While there are no hard prerequisites, everyone who attends should have:

* An IDE ( possibly intellij ) deployed on their laptop
* Developed and ran a hello world application in Scala or Python in their IDE
** Some comfort level in working with AWS
** Some comfort level in working with Linux
** Some basic programing skills
** Basic familiarity with Git.


== Course Objectives

* Give you a scenic tour of the products that comprise Cloudera's stack
* Give you the language needed to speak to speak confidently to practitioners
* Give you the sympathy needed to understand customer pains with our stack
* Ensure everybody has a grasp on the basic building blocks for development using the Cloudera
product set, for testing functionality to answer questions or deploy at the customer


== Expected From You!

* If you find something very easy, help someone else figure it out via slack or zoom
* Try to solve blockers before you reach out struggle for at least 10 minutes, google is a friend
* Also don’t get bogged down with an error for too long, if you are stuck with something for 30 minutes
get somebody to help you. There is a lot of content to get though, you want want to get through it all
* Capture information about what you achieved, what worked well, what was challenging, and metrics such as performance
* Have great notes in git that you can reuse in the future

== Submitting Work

* All work is submitted to your GitHub repo
** Add your instructor `alexciobanu`  as Collaborators
** We'll review git/GitHub tools in class
** Use AsciiDoc for text and PNG format for screenshots
* We score each lab/challenge as `Complete`, `Incomplete`, or `Did Not Submit`
* The final evaluation is `Pass`, `Provisional Pass`, or `No Pass`
* We evaluate your labs for
** Completing tasks as directed
** Documenting your progress on a regular basis
** Showing your work

=== Use Case

link:https://nyti.ms/2jRIEnF[ Gravitational wave ]

Your mission should you choose to accept it:

* Find gravitational waves in astronomical detector measurements
* Provide the measurement data set for end user querying

You should:

* Make it easy to query for finding the gravitational waves
* Make the queries run fast
* Minimize the time for measurements to be available after they are made
* Minimize the effort involved in loading new measurements

==== Data Model

One record is one measurement:

Each measurement is:
* At a point in time
* Made up of three signal amplitudes
* From a gravitational wave detector somewhere in the world
* Being performed by an astrophysicist
* Listening to a nearby galaxy

`*A gravitational wave is detected when the first and third amplitudes are > 0.995, and the second amplitude is < 0.005*`

Now let's get to the tech!
