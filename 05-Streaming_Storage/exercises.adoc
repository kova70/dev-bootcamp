=== Exercise 0 - Preparation

Time to build a steaming pipeline for our gravitational wave detector.

To create at steam of data use the generator available in github:
link:http://tiny.cloudera.com/gravity-generator[Data Generator].

To run the downloaded jar the syntax is:

....
java -cp bootcamp-0.1.0.jar com.cloudera.fce.bootcamp.MeasurementGenerator <hostname> <port>
....

To view the data steam you can use the `nc` command

=== Exercise 1

Use NiFi to create a pipeline where the generated data is inserted into Kafka

You want to make sure the data is unchanged in the process.

Take a screenshot of relevant part of your canvas and put into labs/nifi.png

=== Exercises 2

Use NiFi to create a pipeline where the generated non measuremnets data into HBase

You want to make sure the data is unchanged in the process.
