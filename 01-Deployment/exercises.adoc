== Deploy a data Lake

=== Before You Start

* link:link:../README_GitHub.adoc[Follow instructions here] if you haven't already
* Remember to submit text-based work in AsciiDoc and screenshots as PNG files
** Use code formatting (``...``) at a minimum
* Create an Issue in your repo called `Deployment Lab`
** Add it to the `Labs` milestone
** Assign the label `started`
* Use the issue to note your lab progress
** Add a comment when you have finished a lab section
** Add a comment if you run into a puzzling error or other blocker
** If you also fix it a problem, comment on the cause and solution

=== Prerequisite

1. You will need to have an AWS account and admin access. You should have that before you start this course
1. You need to have a CDP tenant. Look for an OKTA tile with the cdp sandbox logo.
1. Familiarize yourself with the link:https://cloudera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SE/pages/90014288/Cloud+Tagging+Requirements+Data+Retention+Policy[AWS Tagging Requirements and Data Retention Policies] +

**Please tag _everything_ you create in AWS with the following:**
|===
|Key |Value

|enddate
|MMDDYYYY

|owner
|okta/${email username}

|project
|basecamp/${basecamp start date}
|===

* Example:

 enddate:04242020
 owner:okta/jrobinson
 project:basecamp/04202020

=== Prepare S3

1. Login to AWS console ( pick your favorite region, and don't change it for the rest of the week, trust me .. )

1. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html[Create the S3 Bucket] for the data and logs named with your personal `github-id`. +
If the name is taken add a numerical suffix

1. In the S3 bucket create the following folders

.. Log folder : <github-id>/log/
.. Data folder : <github-id>/data/

=== Setup AWS IAM 
*WARNING: All of the jsons have replace variables, don't just copy and paste*

Below are variables need to be replaced by your own S3 Bucket path in json files. Make a link:resources/variables.adoc[variable file] of your own environment to make your life easier.

.. ${LOGS_BUCKET} : <github-id>
.. ${LOGS_LOCATION_BASE} : <github-id>/log
.. ${STORAGE_LOCATION_BASE} : <github-id>/data
.. ${DATALAKE_BUCKET} : <github-id>
.. ${DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME} : <github-id>
.. ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID} : the account id of your AWS account
.. ${IDBROKER_ROLE} : <github-id>-idbroker-role

=== Create IAM policies

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html#access_policies_create-json-editor[Create the 6 needed IAM policies]. Each name is a link to the sample policy json. +

1. link:https://github.com/hortonworks/cloudbreak/blob/master/cloud-aws/src/main/resources/definitions/cdp/aws-cdp-dynamodb-policy.json[<github-id>-dynamodb-policy]

=== Create IAM roles

Now that we have access policies let's create roles which will use these policies. There are 4 roles to create
with the specified permissions ( Permissions / policy(s) needed for each role are indented in the followed lines  )

1. <github-id>-idbroker-role
.. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html[Type of trusted entity]: Ec2
.. Policies:
* <github-id>-idbroker-assume-role-policy

1. <github-id>-log-role
.. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html[Type of trusted entity]: Ec2
.. Policies:
* <github-id>-log-policy-s3access
* <github-id>-bucket-policy-s3access

1. <github-id>-datalake-admin-role
.. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html[Type of trusted entity]: another AWS Account
.. Account:  ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}
.. Policies:
* <github-id>-bucket-policy-s3access
* <github-id>-dynamodb-policy
* <github-id>-datalake-admin-policy-s3access

1. <github-id>-ranger-audit-role
.. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html[Type of trusted entity]: another AWS account
.. Account:  ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}
.. Policies:
* <github-id>-bucket-policy-s3access
* <github-id>-ranger-audit-policy-s3access
* <github-id>-dynamodb-policy

=== IAM Role Trusts

1. OK, roles not done yet. Some of the roles need trust relationships .. yeah I know, it will be over soon ...
Setup the following trust relationships:

.. <github-id>-datalake-admin-role -> Trust Relationships
* link:resources/aws-cdp-idbroker-role-trust-policy.json[idbroker-role-trust-policy]
.. <github-id>-ranger-audit-role -> Trust Relationships
* link:resources/aws-cdp-idbroker-role-trust-policy.json[idbroker-role-trust-policy]

=== Cross account permission setup

We can create the cross account AIM role. This will be used by Control plane to enter your account
and deploy the different VMs and K8s instances.

* Follow the instructions link:https://docs.cloudera.com/management-console/cloud/credentials-aws/topics/mc-create-credentialrole.html[in the documentation]

* You can name the newly created role and policy whatevery you would like though use the <github-id> prefix to easly identify it
and reduce the chance of name collision.

* Don't forget to get the IAM Role ARN you are going to need it in the next step


The final step is to create is to role-based credential, basically given your little world of control plane,
access to your AWS account. It is though this access Control Plane can auto create ec2 for datalakes and datahubs and some k8s for experiences.

* Follow the instructions link:https://docs.cloudera.com/management-console/cloud/credentials-aws/topics/mc-create-role-based-credential.html[in the documentation]
* Name the Credential: <github-id>-aws-credentials

=== Setup a ssh key pair

In AWS you need to setup an SSH key pair, which you will give to Control Plan. All
ec2 instances that will be created will use this key pair, so you can ssh into the nodes
after they are auto created.

In the AWS Console:

1. Make sure the region is still correct ( changing regions will hurt you )
2. Go to EC2 -> Key Pairs -> Create Key Pair
3. name the Key <github-id>-basecamp-keypair
4. Click Create Key Pair
5. Save the pem file in a safe location for use to ssh into your nodes


=== Deploy your CDP Environment and Lake

1. You are now ready to deploy CDP environment. *Name the environment <github-id>*

Follow the instructions link:https://docs.cloudera.com/management-console/cloud/environments/topics/mc-environment-register-aws-ui.html[in the documentation],
or you can follow the steps below, both paths should take you to the same place.

.. Navigate to the Management Console > Environments > Register environment
.. On the Register Environment page, provide the following information
* env name: <github-id>
* credential: <github-id>-aws-credentials
* datalake name: <github-id>
* Data Lake version: 7.1.0
* region: Must be in same region as your S3 bucket
* network: select create new network 10.10.0.0/16
* security access setting: select create new security groups 0.0.0.0/0
* ssh Setting: <github-id>-basecamp-keypair

* Log storage and Audits
** Select an Instance Profile : <github-id>-log-role
** Logs Location Base : <github-id>/log
** Ranger Audit Role : <github-id>-ranger-audit-role
* Data access
** Select an Instance Profile : <github-id>-idbroker-role
** Storage Location Base : <github-id>/data
** Data Access Role : <github-id>-datalake-admin-role
* Add Tags
** enddate : 05092020
** owner : okta/<okta_ID>
** project : basecamp
* Enable S3Guard : ${DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME}
* Click Register Environment

Now it's time for a break, it will take at least 45 minutes to fail if you got on of the pre-requests wrong, or 60 minutes to deploy everything successfully.

If it' succeeded congratulations, if it failed, well you need to fix it. See the logs and what you got worng anf fix it!

Do not continue until you have a working datalake

=== Deploy a new bucket for Data

Create S3 bucket for Customer Data

* Create a bucket S3 called <github-id>-data
* Create a folder in the bucket called <github-id>-data/gravity


=== Create entities needed for data access

Now that we have a datalake, it would be great to get some data. We are going to
put all of our data in a different bucket, but arbitrary of where we put our day
we will still need to set thing up in AWS and CDP for us to be able to get access
to data from within our CDP environment

1. Create following AMI policies
( same as you did above, don't forget to replace variables as needed )
.. link:resources/gravity-policy.json[<github-id>-gravity-policy]

1. Crate AMI roles using that policy

.  <github-id>-gravity-role
.. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html[Type of trusted entity]: another AWS Account
.. Account:  ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}
.. Policies:
* <github-id>-gravity-policy
* <github-id>-dynamodb-policy

1. Create AMI role trust

.. <github-id>-gravity-role â†’ Trust Relationships
... <github-id>-gravity-role
*  link:resources/aws-cdp-idbroker-role-trust-policy.json[idbroker-role-trust-policy]

1. Create Admin group in CDP
.. In CDP, navigate to: Management console > User Management > Groups > Create Group
.. Create group with:
* name: cdp_<github-id> ( don't get creative with the name ... )
* Make sure to uncheck "Sync Membership"
* Add yourself to that group
* Click Actions > Update groups > uncheck "sync membership"

1. Test the setup
